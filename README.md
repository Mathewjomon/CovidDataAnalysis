# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data using Python. It highlights data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual representation of key insights through various plotting libraries.
## Features
**Monthly Trends**: Line chart showing the trends of COVID-19 metrics (cases, deaths, recoveries) over time.        
**Percentage Distribution Among WHO Regions**: Pie chart to display the percentage distribution of confirmed cases across WHO regions.       
**Time Series Analysis**: Line chart to show trends of COVID-19 metrics (cases, deaths, recoveries) over time.        
**Treemap Representation**: Visualized total cases and deaths across countries.             
**Population-to-Test Ratio**: Bar chart to visualize the ratio of population to tests across countries.
